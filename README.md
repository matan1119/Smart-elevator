# Smart-elevator
Smart emergency elevator for hospitals


Final project in Practical Electronics 2014



The smart elevator came to help nurses and doctors in hospitals.


The elevator can be booked in advance via remote control and reach the elevator that is already on the floor to which it was ordered.


Using the elevator can save waiting time with the patient in the elevator and thus save lives.
